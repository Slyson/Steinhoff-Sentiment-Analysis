# Steinhoff-Sentiment-Analysis
A sentiment analysis project. The corpus are scraped tweets from 2015 to 2019.
Each tweet had to have had at least 5 likes to be considered, as tweets with 1 and 0 likes appeared mostly to be nonesense, in the context of this projec, at least.
I use TF-IDF and LDA for information retrieval.
